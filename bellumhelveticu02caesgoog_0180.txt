5. The tense of the verb in the subordinate clause also depends on the
verb clsaying (or mental aetion) according to the law oi the Sequeroe of
Tenues. Ι

In this relation, the tenses are divided into primary (or principal)
and secandam⁷ (historical) ae follows:

sffiglt [imperfect

Primary , Secondary perfect (historical)
perfect (definite)
{future perfect pluperfeot

The rule ior the Sequence of Tenses is:
Primaxy tennes (in the principal clause) are followed by primaiy
tenses (in the subordinate clause) and secondery tenses by second-
ary tense& Thus [text olLVIII) the perfect historical respondit is fol-
lowed by secondary tenses vellent and reverterentur in the subordinate

clauses.

Other illustratione of the Sequence of Tenses will be found in the lol-
lowing lessons.
