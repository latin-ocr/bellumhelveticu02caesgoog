NOTES
1. bellandi‚os molricg war (of waiting) is the genitive of the gerund

of the verb bello. The gerund is formed by adding to the present stem
Α -nd- with the endings oi the oblique cases (gen. det. acc. abl.) of a neuter
¹ noun in the second declension‚ singular number. It is thereforea verbal
noun governing the same cases ae its verb and ia itself governed as a
noun. It closely corresponda in meaning to the English noun ending in
ung. App. 125; Α. 114, 2953 o. 425 ff.; Η. 200, 11; P. 548 (1).

2. bellandi cupidi, fond os werrico. The quality denoted by cupidi
is directed toward bellandi as its obiect3 bellandi is therefore an object-
ive genitive (genitivus obiectious) governed by the adjective cupidi. Other
adjectivae which require an obiect of reference are those denoting knowl-
edqo, power, still, elo. App. 553 A. 218 and a3 G. 3743 Η. 399; P. 359, 360.

PENSUM VICESIMUM SEXTUM

Iwrronucronr Norna:

1. In the passive voice the tenses formed from the present stem (XXIV,
intr. note 4) in the Indicative and Subiunctive modes have the following
personal endings:

Singularis Pldralis
-0r‚ -r (Ι) -mur (wo)
·ris‚ -re (thou,you) ·mini (youl
-tur (he, she, it) ·ntur (they)

2. By employing these terminatione instead of the active forms (XXIV,
intr. note 3) the present, imperfect, and future tenses in the passive are
formed exactly as the corresponding tenses in the active (XXIV, intr,
notae, 4, 5, 6), thus from amare, lo loce, we have:

Tempus praesens
Singularis Plsrrs'ilis
tamtan-or, Ι am loved ama-mur, we are loved
eamd-ria, (·re), you are loved ama-min1‚ you are loved

ama-tur, he (she, it) is loved ama-ntur, they are loved
