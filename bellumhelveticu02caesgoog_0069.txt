2. H„ Messala, etc. a. As the consuls, the tvo executive officere of
the Roman republic, were elected annually‚ their names were often usad
to designate the year of their administration. b. In translating an ab·
breviation (as Μ.) always give tha full form which the abbreviation desig·
nates.
3. Observa that the phrase Μ. Messalla et M. Pisone cdnsulibus is

grammatically independent of the rest of the sentence, i. e. it is an abso-
lute construction. This construction is called the Ablabius Absolute (ab- ’
1111111111 absolutus). Aparticiple (or group of participles) is most
frequently used with a noun (or group of nouus) in this construction, but
when the place of the participle is filled hy a noun (or adjective) the
participial idea of haina is implied: thus, Marcus Messala aad Marcus
Piso ‘halaq' anmals. The best English style, however, avoids the particip-
ial construction. The phrase may bc rendered, ia lbe consulship of Mar-
cas Messala aad Marcus Piso. App. 983 A. 255 and a; G. 409, 4103 H. 431,
43 P. 422.

4. Nouus ending, in aas, genitive tatis, (e. g. cupiditas, ndbilitas,
civitas) arc of the feminine gender. For formation of the nominative
from the stem, see XII, Intr. N. 2.
