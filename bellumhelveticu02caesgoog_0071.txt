verb oi saying suggested by persudstt in the preceding sentence. When
an infinitiva follows a verb oi mental action, i. e. of declarinp or thinlrinp
(expressed or understood), it should be translated into English by the in·
dicative mode. 1 Thus, perfacile esse, (rapine) taor it is very easy. This
is called the infinitiva in indirect discourse (drdtid obliqua). The direct
discourse (drdtid recto) i. e. the exact words oi Orgetorix, would read per-
facileestitievcryeaap. cf. Galldsobtiuerc dictum cst, XII. App. A.
