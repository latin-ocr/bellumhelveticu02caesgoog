Dicite haee Latine:

There were two reads-were in all two reads—by which
they could go forth—one read-a narrow and difficult road
--between the mountain and the river-with difficulty-
where caris one by one-where carts could be drawn—
mount Jura was overhanging-the mountains are very high

- so that a very few could check— so that they could easily
check the Helvetians.

Sequentia litteris Latinis mandate:

1. There was one road by which he could go from home.
2. The road was narrow and difficult between the mountain
and the river. 3. High mountains were overhanging the
