tion ot the reporter’s sententie, the altered languaga is ealled an indirect
qrwtatioa, and the eonstruotion is called Indireot Disaoarse (aratia obli-
qua). The indireet discourse naturally follows verbs and expressions
signfiying, to sap, tell, issam, thiale, peractae, understand, bow: i. e. verbs
oi savina or of mental aetion.

2. In Indireot Diseourse a panaipat (declarativa) olause has its subjeot
in the aeeewatiee and its verb in the infinitiva. cf. (ababa) εδ merito· Ι
esse, (theu sau) that tbey bave deamat, in tha last lasson; alsa, biennium
satis esse dl'rxdruntt theu considered ibat two years were sufficient
(XXXII); ῦὸ partitos asse arbitrati sunt, they thoafflrt they were prepared
(XLVII);sbse persuasdros esse existimabant (va neget εδ posse
(LXII); eto. See XX, 1, 2. Observe that in the translation oi these
clauses the English idiom requires the nominative er‘rd indicative and
usually the introductory eonjunotion that, although the Latin has no
introductory word.

3. Iu Indireot Diseourse all subordinate or imperative, olauses have
their verbs in the eabjaaetiee. e. g.

a. (dicam) ιδ ita meritos esse, ntegri vastati ndu debuerint, they
say that they boae so deseeeed that their fieids oapht aot to have beea laia

’ waste (LXIX); si vim ednentur, (si) prohibiturum (esse) ostendit, be
&alares that be will stop themis they attempt (to ase) soree. Here ut . . .
debuerint and si . . . ednentur are subordinate alausas in Indireot dis·

oourse and therefore have the verb in the subjunctive. If the subordinate
verb was subjunotive in Direet Disoourse it remeius subjnnotive in Indi·
reot Disoourse.

b. (Caesar) respondit, . . . ed fd. Apr. reverterentur, (Caesar) aa·
swered . . . ibat they should return about tbe middle of April. In Direot
Diseourse (bevitid rbeta) Caesar, in addressing the legates, naturally used
theimparative, revertimini,retarn; but in Indireot Disaourse this irn-
perative becomes subjunctive.

- e. No exemplos oi interrogativa clauses in Indireot Disoourse oeour in
the, text oi Bunnuu Hanvurrouu exeepting rhetorical questions im-
plying their ovvn answer ‚which have their verb in the infinitivo: e. g. num
recentium inidrdrium memoriam deponere posse, aoann be serpet (or
patawap the recollectioa os) tbe reeeat saronas. Other interrogative alausas
have their verbs in the Subjunetive in Indireot Disaourse.
