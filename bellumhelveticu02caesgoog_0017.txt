rho lessons are intended to be studied in the order ¹in
which they occur, and in general it will be well to follow the
order ot the divisione as laid down. Explain in advance how
tue tasson should be studied, and direct the student’s at-
tention to the special points to be considered.

Insist from the beginning upon a correct pronunciation‚
and secure a ready and intelligent reading of the Latin text.

Require a thorough mastery of the vocabularies and of
each form and principle as taken up, and then review, re-
view, aavlaw. Besides a daily review, have a general ex-
amination as often as once a month. In daily raview much
of the work may be done rapidly by the class iu concert.

In the recitation of the lesson,- .

1. Pronounce the words in the vocabularies‚ and require
the pupil to give not only the English definitione but also
Latin equivalent as thecorresponding English is pronounced.
If there are English derivativae, or nearly synonymous Latin
words, let them be given in connection with each new word·

2. After. translation (see 6. below) and the recitation of
any memorized passages, break up the textos the lesson into
short passages, and let the pupil answer as the words are
pronounced by the toacher. This exercise should be mainly
English into Latin, using the exercise presented in the les-
son, or abridging, extending or otherwise varying it, so that
the pupil will have such a completa knowledge of the text
tharha will promptly render English into Latin or Latin
into English assoon as the words of either langnage are

pronounced.
