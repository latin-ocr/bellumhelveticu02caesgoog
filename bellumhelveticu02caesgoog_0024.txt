111. Pronuneiation. The pronunciation of Latin varies in different
countries. In America the methods most commonly employed arethe
¹ Roman and the English. At present the Roman methodis more largely
followed, while the English method is retained by those who desire to
give special prominence to the principles of English pronunciation and
to the derivation of English words from the Latin. .

IV. nheaoman Method. Bytho Roman method every letter has
always the same sound, as follows: ·

Vowels: a es in suthem a as in idea.
e “ rtem e “ aar.
i ‘⁸ maeleim i “ hadita.
ὃ “ holm ο “ oben.
dasooin mecm u “ sall.
y like French u or Germanii.

It will be observed that the short vowels have the samesounds as the
long vowels, but they are pronounced more quickly and lightly. ’

Along vowel marked d is counted as equal to two short ones not
marked.

Diphthongs: ae like aye or ai in aiala· oe like oi in caim
au like ow in now,· ei asin eight3
eu like ew (eh-cc); ui like wc (occe).

Oonsonants as in English except:
cand g always hard, as income, qum t always hard3
i consonant (j) like ω s sharp as in sale, lipa· v like w,·
z like dc in adca· qu as in English; bs, bt like pa, pf,·
ph like s; ch like k: n before c, g, k, q, x as in amtor,
anquish, enciens. A.1c; G. 3-73 A. 6, 7; Ρ. 15-18.

V. nhc English sterben. In the English methcd the sounds are
generally the same as in English*

1. Thus, vowels have their long English sounds -

α. In final syllables ending in a vowel, as se, dd, except that unaccent·
ed final a is scunded like final a in Arrrerica.

b. In all syllables before a vowel or diphthong, as deus, dedrum.

c. In penultimate syllables (the last but one), and in unaccented sylla·
bles, not final, before a single consonant, or before a mute followed by a
liquid; as frdter, doloris, cdnsulis, patrem: but unaccented i and y, ex-
cept in the first and last syllable, are usually short.

d. In words like Achaia, Pompeius, i preceded by an accented a, e,

0, or y, and followed by another vowel, has the sound oi y; thus, A-ka

rerom-re-rus· ,
*li the English method ci pronunciaticn be adopted, it fs recommended that
it be learned by actual practice with porticus oi Latin text, these rules being used ior
reference. and notior recitation.
