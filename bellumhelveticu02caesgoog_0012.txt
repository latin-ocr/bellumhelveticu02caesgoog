in repeatedly looking up the ¹same word-strengthens the
memory, cultivates the attention, and secures accurate knowl-‘

edge¹ ⁸The general vocabulary at the end of the book should
be unnecessary, except, perhaps, for words which rarely occur.

Second: The study of the composition of Latin words is
early introduced and persistently continued. The derivation
of English words from the Latin is considered of such great
importance that 'a call for such derivative words is affixed to

each vocabulary.
Third: The text of the first twenty-nine chapteffi of Gaesar’s
Gallic War (up to the end of the Helvetian War) is used as

presenting a model of perfect Latinity, sufficiently simple in ’

form and structure for the beginner. It affords an illustra-
tion of the most important principles of the language‚ and
prepares the student for a further study of ansar. After
thoroughly learning the words and translating into English,
the student is advised to memoriae the text for a few lassans,
for the purpose of securing a model for the ordercf words as
well as fixing the pronunciation. This may not be deemed
advisable by all toachers3 but it is earnestly urged, as essen-
tial to entire thoroughness, that the student become so fa-
miliar with tha text that he can give the English for the Lat-
in or the Latin for¹ the English when pronounced by the
teacher. The text of the twenty-nine chapters‚ given con-
nectedly after the lessonS, will be found convenient for reviews.
Fourth: For the convenience of teachers, and to give defi-
nite direction to the student's work, the substance of the text
is given in short portione ,in dictation exercises—the
student being required to translate orally as pronounced by
the toacher. This gives opportunity to vary forms and
constructions, fixas the meaning of words, and insures fa-
miliarity with the text. The matter given in these exercises
can easily be modified and extended at the pleasure of the in-
structor.
Fifth: The same text is used as the basis for English sen-
