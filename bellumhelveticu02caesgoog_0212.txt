lioly promised to bring grain to Caesar. 5. As was said be-
fore, in the first chapter, Gaul slopes toward the north. 6.
Caesar thought that not even a sufficiently great supply of
fodder was at hand. 7. The grain in that place was not ripe,
because of the oold. 8. Caesar turned away from the Saone
because he wished to follow up the Helvetians. 9. For this
reason he was not able to use the grain. 10. ansar’s ships
were bringing the grain on the river Saone. 11. Caesar was ¹
put off from day to day by the Aeduans. 12. TheAeduans
said that the grain was being collected and was being carried
to Caesar. ·13. The Aeduans put off ansar too long. 14. It was
necessary for Caesar to measure out grain to his men. 15
Liscus, who was over the highest office, was called vergobret
bytho Aeduans. 16. The vergobrets were appointed annual-
ly and had the power of life and death over their people¹ (ia
suos). 17. Diviciacus and Liscus were among the chief men
whom Caesar called together. 18. The Aeduan chiettains
·- were severely censured by ansar because they did not assist

him with grain. 19. Since he could neither buy grain nor ⁸

take it from the fields, it was necessary that he be aided by
them. 18. Caesar thought he ought to be aided in so critic-
al a time, with the enemy so near. 20. Caesar said that he
had undertaken the war influenoed in a great measure (muy-
rrci ex purte) by their entreaties. 21. ansar was complain-
ing the more bitterly because he had been abandoned. 22.
The vergobret, who holds (15 over) the highest office, will
measure the grain.

Quoties (how often) flagitavit Caesar trumentum? Quomo-

Cur frumentum maturum non erat? Ubi est Gallia posita?
Num pabuli satis magna copia suppetebat? (Minime, satis
magna copia non suppetebat.) Quo in flumine subvehebat
