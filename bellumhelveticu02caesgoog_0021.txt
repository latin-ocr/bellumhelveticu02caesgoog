ing their country they provided themselves plentiiully with

provisione, and burned all their houses, some four hundred .

villagee and twelve walled towns. By appointmont they met
at the southern point of Lake Genava. There they assembled
in the spring of 58 Β. o, to the number of three hundred and
sixty-eight thousand, of whom ninety-two thousand were
men-at-arms. Under modern civilization, the same country

now supporta a population of two milliens eight hundred and

At Lake Geneva the Helvetii found their advancc opposed
by Caesar. Their most natural course was to cross the Rhone,
passing through a comer of the Roman province in south-
eastern Gaul. They sent a deputation asking permission to
pass through the province without damage. To gain time,
ansar put them off toa second contemnes, spent the inter-
val in constructing alins offortifications along the Rhone,
and then formally iorbade their passage.

After vainly endeavoring to force a passage of the Rhone,
the Helvetii, by arrangement with the Sequani, their neigh-
bors on the northwest, proceeded to orosa the Saone instead
oi the Rhone and thence to march westward. ansar added
five fresh legions to the four already at his disposal, and
after about three-fourths oi the Helvetian troops had crossed
the Saone, fell upon and out to pieoes the remainder. Efferts
on the partos the Helvetii to procure terme of peace satisfac-
tory to themselves proved unavailing, and after some minor
conteets‚ the final decisivo battle was fought at the Aeduan
town, Bibracte, now Autun. Caesar aoknowledges that the
battle was closely contested and for a long time doubtful, but
in the end Roman arms and discipline won a victory that
ended all the hopes of the Helvetii. At the command of
Caesar they returned to their desolated homes, but with the
loss of more than two-thirds of their entire number. Re-

· mains of skeletons‚ ornaments, and arms have been unearthed

on the field oi the great battle near Autan.
