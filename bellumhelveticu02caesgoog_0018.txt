3. The writing of the prescribed sentences, both in an

exercise book and on the blackboard, should be required
throughout all the lessona

4. The exercise for questioning in Latin, like the dicta-
tion exercise, is intended to be suggestive, and can easily be
varied and amplified. This is a most inspiring as well as 0
most profitable exercise. The Glossary furnishes terms nec·
essary for its extension.

5. The principles and facts 01 the notes should be -

thoroughly learned and recited. Although frequent refer-
ences are made to the same principle, it should not be neces-
sary for the student to occupy his time in turning to the
first explanation.

6. In translating, the student should be taught 10 00001-
10111 the thought in the Latin order, and first translate the
words literally, just as they stand in the text, noting the
grammatical form of each word and all its possible construc-
tions. Thus, His rebus 0111111011 01 auctoritate Orgetorigis
permoti, constituerunt cc qurrc od proficiscendum pertinerent

compartire, etc, should corne 10 the mind in the order 01 the ’

original: “By these things led and by the influence 01 Orget-
orix thoroughly roused, they determined, those things which
to departing pertained, to prepare.” An excellent exercise

101 training the student 10 use the Latin order and prevent ’

his picking out words in the attempt to find an English 01-
der, is to take a sentence ·(the toacher giving the meaning of
the first form of unfamiliar words) and write it 011 the black-
board one word 010 111110, calling upon the student 10 give
the meaning, word by word, as the sentence progresses.
