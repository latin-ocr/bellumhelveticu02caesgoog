TO TEAGHERS 13

in the Latin order, and it is desired to translate into English,
teachers should insist that good idiomatic English be used
and purely Latin idioms avoided. Thus the frequent use of
the perfect passive participle in Latin is not tobe imitated iu
English, but an active participle, or more frequently a clause,
should be used instead; the Subiunctive must be rendered
more frequently by the indicative or infinitivo than by the
potential, the auxiliaries ot the potential are to be employed
in the translation of possum and licet. A translation that
fails to transfer the Latin idioma into good idiomatic Eng-
lish is but hslt a translation. The student’s knowledge of
his own language and his further mastery of it demand that
all translations shall be made in the purest idiomatis English.
A translation is by no means always necessary, as the teacher
’ can easily judge whether the pupil has an intelligent grasp
of the author’s meaning, by the manner in which the Latin

is read, and by questions in Latin on syntex and subject
matter. And he can generally make the subject clear to the
student by a proper reading ot the text and explanation in
Latin3 provided, of course, that the student is familiar with
the forms and meanings ot the words

The division into lessons has been made, largely, in refer-
ence to convenience in dividing the text or in the presenta-
tion ot a subject with a general average of ten new words

’ daily. As a rule, this number, with the related facte, can be

readily and thoroughly learned. However, no rule in re-
gard to the length of lessous can be absolute,except the im-
perative one that it be so measured to the capabilities of the
class as to inaure its complete mastery. With favorable cir-
cumstances, the work here laid down has been completed in
two-thirds ofa college year. The mastery of the contente of
this book, however, represents a considerably greater knowl-
edge ot the lenguage than is usually acquired in one year,
snd so much time should be taken, it necessary, to assure
its thorough completion.
