*NOTES

1. The Latin has no article. The, amera must therefore be supplied
by the student in translating‚ whenever the sense requires it.

2. In Latin questions are answored as follows:

α. Sometimes the substance of the question aeked, is repeated in the
ausser, as in the above esses.

b. The verb or the emphatio word may be repeated tor affirmation
and non added to the verb or emphatio word ior denial.

o. More rarely a simple pes ie represented by suoh confirmatory werde
as ita, ⁸03 sane, sarelm certe, certainly3 aud the simple negative by ndu,
notaomdn verb (quidem),noindlee;minime‚ by no meana. A.212;
G. 473; Η. 3523 P. 582.

3. The interrogative particle nenne expeets an affirmative ausast,
and is rendered is not, are not, do niet, ete. Thus, ndnne verum est? is

doubt consult the Introduetory besson, Iv-VIII, or the grammate
