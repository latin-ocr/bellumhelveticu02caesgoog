NOTES

1. Many verbs which in English govern the direct object, in Latin
govern the Dative of the indirect object: thus, civitati persuasit, he per-
· suadcd (uscdpcrsuasiucarptrments to) the citizens. This is true iu general
of verbs which indirectly effect their object either for good or ill. App.
