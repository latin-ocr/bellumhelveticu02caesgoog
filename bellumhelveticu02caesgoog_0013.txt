tences to be written in Latin. While the thought of thepas-
sago 11 retained in these sentences, their structure is so varied
from the original as to afford thorough grammatical drill.
No new words 111 introduced in this exercise, that no time
may be lost in looking them up. This abundant practice, with
Caesarian models fresh in the mind of the student, produces
readiness in Latin composition and a correct style.

Sixth: The text is treated a fourth time in questions in
Latin tobe answered in Latin by the student. These ques-
tions, sometimes grammatical, sometimes on the facts of the

passage under discussion, promote that mastery of the lan· >

guage which is to be attained only by its use in this way.
These questions are suggestive, and the toacher can vary them
and increase their number, so 11 10 give 1 large part of the
instruction in this form if he desires.

Seventh: Paradigms of declensions and conjugatione with
the principles of syntax are introduced gradually, after the
student has acquired words and sentences illustrating these
forms and principles. The book is complete without 1 gram-
mar, but references are continually made 11 the leading gram-
mare, and the student 11 encouraged to study by subjecta from
illustretive examples. Each principle is explained but once,
and when illustratione of the same fact appear, reference is
made by figures to the first example and explanation. 'Phe ex-
planatione of the text and of grammatical principles are given
in notes in connection with each lesson. These notes are 10
be thoroughly learned and recited‚ to insure thoroughness and
prevent waste of time in frequently referring to the same
subject. .

No apology is offered for the use of words and terma in the
colloquial exereises which are not found in classioal authore,
but only in grammars and commentarios. The use of such

words and terme 11 necessary 10 conversation in Latin, and a
knowledge of the later Latin 11 11 be desired rather than to
be avoided. ⁸
