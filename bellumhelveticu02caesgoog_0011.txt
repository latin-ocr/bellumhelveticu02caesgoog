THIS book has been prepared to satisfy the demand of many
toachers that the Latin be made, at the beginning, a living
subject for the student3 and that the ability to compose and
think in Latin be developed, along with translating and the
acquiring oi grammatical principles,

Its present form is due to a close observation of the needs
ol the student as determined by the actual use of these les-
sons in the class-roem in years past, and to the uniformly
resulting increase in enthusiasm, thoroughness, and amount
oi work done by the student.

To master the Latin, the Latin itself must be used. To
the English student the theory must be presented in English,
but the class-room practice may be largely in Latin, and thus

the student will become familiar with the language by using
it in thought and speech. To bring the student to this famil-
iar use oi the Latin the following plan is pursued.

Eirst: Immediately after the text, the meaning of the
Latin words, as they occur in the order of the tert, is given
in English, and the student is required to give both the
English equivalent for the Latin and the Latin for the En-

glish as pronounced by the teaoher. Each vocabulary oon-
tains an entirely new set of words. Itis expected that the
pupil will thoroughly master the words oi each lesson, so
that he will recognize them as they occur again and again in
the text. This sares the time of the student-so often wasted
