portsr's sentenee; puer dicit ῦὸ ire Rdmam, the hog says that he ie poian
to Roma' An indirect quotation ie thus seen to be the direct object ot
some verb of capion. Hceana that ha ia poian. The same grammatical
construction follows verbs of thinking, percaivinp, knowinq, and the like.

verb of saying is present3 e. g, Hc says that Caesar seat in order that ha
might aee, dicit· Gaesarem misisse, ut videret Here viddrat seems to
