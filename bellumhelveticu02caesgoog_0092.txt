NOTES

1. comparere, coemere, faeere: the infinitive is used with many verbs
(as constituerunt, they determinati, also verbs denoting ability, intention,
endeavor, during etc.) which require another action of the same subiect to
complete their meaning. This is called the complementary infinitivo
(infinitivus complimcntcirtus). Thus in the text above facere (also com·
partire, coemere) is the complement of the verb constituerunt (compli-
mentum verbi cdnstitudrunt).

PENSUM TRICESIMUM⁴ PRIMUM.

Review the introductory notes in pianum XXIV.
Inrnonnoroer Norns:

1. The Perfect stem of verbs of the first (d) conjugation (and eleo of the
fourth and often of the second) is regularly formed by adding v to the pres-
ent stem. Thus from amare, present stem amd- we have the perfect stem
amar-3 from compare-re, the perfect stem comparem.

2. The perfect stem of most verbs of the third conjugation whose stem
vowel is long either by nature or position is found by adding s to the
present stem, minus the stem vowel: from directe, present stem dficc· we
have the perfect stem dex-2 from dicere, to say, present stem dice· we
have the perfect stem dix-.

3. The perfect stem is generally the same ns the present stem (minus
the stem vowel) in third conjugation verbs whose present stem has u· (or
nd-) before the stem vowel: thus from constituere, present stem cdnstit·
ue-, we have the perfect stem constitu-.

4. The personal endings of the perfect indicative are

-i (I) -imus (we)
-isti (thou, you) -ietis (you) ’
-it (he, she, it) -drunt -dre (they)

The perfect tense is formed by adding these endings to the perfect stem,

e. g.
amere, totove Present stem emd- Perfect stem amdv· p

'l'empus perfectum
Singularis Phirdlis
amir-i, Ihave loved amdv-imws, we have loved
amar-isid, thou hast loved amer-istis, yon have loved
cmiv-it, he has loved amdv-enmt(-ere), they have loved
