INTRODUOTION ΤΟ ΤΗΕ REVlSED EDITION

m-

The hearty welcome accorded to Bellum Helveticum upon
its first publication in 1889 and the results obtained from its
widely increased use in succeeding years have demonstrated
the correctness and value of its methods. The present re·
vision seeks to embody more completely and clearly the prin·
ciples commended in the ‘Introduction’ and in the remarks
‘To Toachers .’

Additional aid has been given to enable studente, imma-
ture in years or preparation, to proceed with greater facility
and pleasure in the mastery of the difficolt beginnings oi the
Latin tongue. The importance of the methods explained in
the ‘Introduction’ and remarks ‘To Teachers’ is emphasized
by their renewed insertion. Each division in all the lessons
with the Vocabulary, text and Appendix, has been subjected
to a careful review. ’

The following are some ol the more important features of
this revision:

Shortening of many of the lessons

Conformation ot all the lessons to the same general form.

Exhibition of all the grammatical forms in the body of the
successive lassans.

Additional notea, references, and practice exercises for all
difficult constructions‚ especially for Indirect Discourse.

Insertion ot mapa and illustrative cuts of weapons and
armor.
