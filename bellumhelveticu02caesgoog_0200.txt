Sequentia litteris Latinis mandete:

1. The Roman people were deceived in this, because they
· did Ποῖ know that anything (aliquid) had been done (com-
missum) by them wherefore they should tear. 2. They did
not think they ought to tear (i must be ieared by them)
without a cause. 3. Caesar did Ποῖ vvish to forget the recent
wrongs. 4. Oculd Caesar forget the former insult? 5. The
Helvetians attempted a mareh through the province against
his will. 6. Caesar was not able to forget the wrongs of the
Aeduans and Ambarri. 7. Caesar endured these insults with
annoyance because he was Ποῖ conscious oi any wrong. 8
We should mention the merits of the Helvetians. ·9. , Bevvare
lest something (aliquid) befall you (tihi). 10. Forget all

doubts

Latine his respondete:

Num Caesar veteris contumeliae oblivisci volebat? (Neu
pute eum id voluisse.) Num Caesar recentium inierierum
memoriam deponere poterat? (Minime, ansar . . . nen pot-
erat.) Quomodo Helvetii iter per previnciam temptaverant?
Ques popules vexaverant Helvetii]> Quae essent Caesaris
verba eretiene in recte? (Caesaris verba eretiene in recte
essent3 Sed ee deceptus est, quod neque commissum e se in-
tellegebat, quere timeret, neque sine cause timendum pute-
bat. Quod si veteris contumeliae oblivisci vole, num etiam
recentium inierierum, quod me invite iter per previnciam
pervim temptevistis, quod Aedues, quod Ambarres, quod Al-
lobrogas vernemetis, memoriam depenere pessumi)

The answer to the last question represents the direct discourse as re-
constructed from the text of the lasson. Note and justify each change
according to the principles stated in LXX.
