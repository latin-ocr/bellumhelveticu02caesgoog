LATIN-ENGLISH VOCABULARY.

————

'I'his vocabulary, briefly defining each'word employed in the text of the
Helvetian war, is designed mainly as an index to words more fully treated
in the special vocabularies which accompany each lesson.

In eompound words prefixes are separated by a hyphen. The defini-
tions given will enable the student easily to determine whether the prefix
in· Is the negative particle or the proposition meaning on, against,
over, etc.

The declension can be distinguished by ,the termination of the genitiva
singular. The figures 1, 2, 4, placed after the first form ofa verb in· ⁹
dicate that the principal parts are formed just as in the model verbs
amo, monae, audio. When a figure does not thus indicate the verb
Ι to be regular and all the principal parts aro not given, ft will be
understood that those not given are rarely if ever found. The perfect
passive participle, and not the supine, is employed as the last of the
priucipal parts because the formation of the compound tenses of the pas-
sivo voice is thus more easily explained, a'nd also because, as hasbeen
shown, in a large proportion of Latin verbs, no supine is found. Roman

numerals placed after the definitione indicate the lesson where the word ·

fs more fully treated. The references in bold-faced Arabio numerals
are to chapters. The mastery of words given as they occur in the
preceding lassons should make frequent reference to this vocabulary
unnecessary.
